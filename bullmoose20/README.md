# Plex Meta Manager Configs

This repo contains configs from several people (meisnate12/Sohjiro, yozora, cpt-kuesel, chazlarson) and a bit of my own twist. 

A full version of this including all the images that I use can be found here: http://tiny.cc/bullmoose20pmmstuff

Use scripts at your own risk!!!

NOTE: Some "people" folders will look strange because of Windows. For example: "Robert Downey Jr." has a trailing period which is not acceptable in Windows Folder names
