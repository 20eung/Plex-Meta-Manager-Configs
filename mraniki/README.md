## Metadata

Metadata structure
```yaml
# Prefixes for Movie Collections:
#   +01_ = Charts
#   +02_ = Holidays
#   +03_ = Studios or Network
#   +04_ = Collection
#   +05_ = Countries
#   +06_ = Genres
#   +07_ = Awards
#   +08_ = Decades
#   +09_ = People
#   +10_ = Movies
```
Prefixes are added to the sort title of the collections in the file that should be sorted at the top of my movies library.
